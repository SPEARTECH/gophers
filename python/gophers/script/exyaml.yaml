        description:
          new: An entity that captures the relevant characteristics of a physical
            site, hosting provider (e.g., Amazon Web Services GOVCLOUDTM), and/or
            location that is used to house physical IT assets (e.g., endpoints, sub-components
            of a FISMA system) and/or agency personnel.
          old: 'For the purposes of the CDM, facilities are any physical space (site,
            campus, building, etc.) that can be documented to facilitate the assignment
            of geographical information for agency personnel or FISMA system components
            (e.g., devices, software, etc.) for physical asset accountability. Facilities
            can be official duty stations, datacenters, or some combination of both.
            In the CDM Data Model, facilities may also be interrelated where one larger
            facility holds and is related to a more specific locale that is more informational
            for documenting an assets physical location (e.g., a server room or datacenter
            inside an agencys campus location). Where the physical location of assets
            is fluid, as is the case with cloud services, provider related information
            (e.g., company name, specific information on hosting agreements) may be
            provided. Facilities may be agency owned/operated or provided as a service
            through a hosting agreement. Under CDM, all co-location, contractor owned/operated,
            and cloud hosting providers should be documented if they are relevant
            to people or devices that are covered by CDM. Note: In many circumstances
            under shared services (e.g., cloud providers) it might not be realistic
            to document actual geographical location. In these scenarios, it is critical
            not to capture the physical location, such as an address, but rather the
            organizational information of the hosting company and any related geographic
            information on the location of the hosting center that is available, which
            may vary by vendor. For example, AWS GovCloud US-EAST Region 1 would be
            an appropriate moniker for virtual servers that are hosted by AWS on behalf
            on an agency.'
